lua one is written by me (the only thing I searched was the argument by chatgpt) and I consider myself to be one of the average developers in lua z
Because I have just started writing lua

The main_optimized.lua is written by claude ai when I asked it to hyper optimize , it uses the table create function which as an average developer I hadn't heard (maybe skill issue from my side)
But admittedly the main_optimized.lua is 2x faster than the one written solely by me

I had then remembered that luajit also exists so I tried to run my code unaltered but it seems that I needed to do some modifications for it to work (which is in main_luajit.lua) and it was written by chatgpt

I am not endorsing AI and I try to use it very minimally , and I had the most fun writing main.lua because it was something that I just wrote by looking at the golang code
